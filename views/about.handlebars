  <p class="text-right">At Eventigo, our mission is to make attending events
    more social, fun, and accessible. We believe no one should have to go to an
    event alone — that’s why we make it easy to connect with others attending
    the same events. By posting comments, sharing plans, and finding companions,
    you can turn any outing into a shared experience. Together, we’re building a
    friendly, active community that brings people closer — one event at a time.
